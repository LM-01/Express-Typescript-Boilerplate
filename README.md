# Express Typescript App Boilerplate

This project serves as a simple and accessible starting point for building Express applications with TypeScript. While the boilerplate code is bare, it provides essential features needed to kickstart development.

## Features

- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript for more robust code.
- **Helmet**: Helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects against brute-force attacks.
- **Docker Support**: Containerized for consistent development and deployment.
- **Nodemon**: Keeps the server alive and refreshes on changes during development.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install`.
3. **Start the server**: Run `npm start`.
4. **Development mode**: Run `npm run dev` to start the server with Nodemon.
5. **Build and Run Docker Container**:

   - Build: `docker build -t my-express-app .`
   - Run: `docker run -p <port>:<port> -e PORT=<port> my-express-app`
